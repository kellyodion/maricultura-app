Read in Rasters
```{r}

empty_rast_econ <- raster("maricultura-app/data/empty_raster.tif")

Setting Number of Farms per Cell

Calculate Fuel Costs

diesel_price <- 0.92 #USD/L

trips_per_day <- 2
trip_hours <- 6 #maximum roundtrip

# Determine Trips per Year

annual_one_per_boat <- (one_way_trips_per_year/num_of_boats) # 730 annual trips for one boat
roundtrips_per_year <- (one_way_trips_per_year/2) # roundtrips for both boats combined is 730

# Create a Raster for Fuel Price
fuel_rast_econ <- reclassify(eez_econ, rcl = diesel_price)

Calculate Wage Costs
```{r}
